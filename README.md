# dnsd

A very basic implementation of a DNS server. This was built to better understand the DNS protocol.

# Implementation

I chose C because I wanted to get "back to basics". I coded in C a long time ago.

# License

I put this code in the public domain. I do not guarantee any parts of the code.
