# dnsd

A very basic implementation of a DNS server. This was built to better understand the DNS protocol.

# Usage

    git clone https://github.com/francois/dnsd
    cd dnsd
    rake
    ./dnsd

# Implementation

I chose C because I wanted to get "back to basics". I coded in C a long time ago.

# License
